# Predicting Alzheimer's

This is a simple program which takes data pertaining to an individual and feeds it to models to determine if they are at risk of developing Alzheimer's.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.
The program takes in all kinds of data, including medical history, family history and traits that will be used by four trained deep learning models to predict if the user is at risk of developing Alzheimers. The models used are an FNN, an MLP, an SVM and a DF Classifier. They have each been trained using various features which now lead to an accurate prediction.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Necessary libraries are:
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* SciKit-Learn
* Pandas
* MatPlotLib

Operating system used for testing and development was conducted on Windows 10/11 and Ubuntu 22.04 (Pop!_OS).

### Installing

* Download the main branch from [GitHub](https://github.com/n1999ck/Alzheimers) and extract the files onto your machine. 

### Executing program

* How to run the program:
* Locate where your extracted files are saved
* Open the extracted file folder
* Open 'main.py'
* Press the run button in your IDE
