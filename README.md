# Predicting Alzheimer's

This is a simple program which takes data pertaining to an individual and feeds it to models to determine if they are at risk of developing Alzheimer's.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.
The program takes in all kinds of data, including medical history, family history and traits that will be used by four trained deep learning models to predict if the user is at risk of developing Alzheimers. The models used are an FNN, an MLP, an SVM and a DF Classifier. They have each been trained using various features which now lead to an accurate prediction.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Necessary libraries are:
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* SciKit-Learn
* Pandas
* MatPlotLib

Operating system used for testing and development was conducted on Windows 10/11 and Ubuntu 22.04 (Pop!_OS).

### Installing

* Download the main branch from [GitHub](https://github.com/n1999ck/Alzheimers) and extract the files onto your machine. 

### Executing program

* How to run the program:
* Locate where your extracted files are saved
* Open the extracted file folder
* Open 'main.py'
* Press the run button in your IDE

# MindWise: Web Client for Alzheimer's Predictor

## Description

This web application predicts the likelihood of Alzheimerâ€™s disease based on user inputs in demographic, lifestyle, medical, and cognitive assessment categories. The frontend is built in React, while a Flask-based API processes the predictions using a machine learning model. The app aims to provide quick, accessible insights into potential Alzheimer's risk for personal or research purposes, differentiating itself by focusing on user-friendly form design and providing immediate prediction results.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n1999ck/Alzheimers-Prediction-App.git
   cd Alzheimers-Prediction-App
   ```

2. **Backend setup**:
   - Create a virtual environment:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

     yarn start-api
     ```

   - In a new terminal window, start the React development server:

     ```bash
     yarn start
     ```

   The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Form Input**: Enter patient data in each field. All input is done through radio buttons, numerical inputs, or selection drop-downs.
- **Submit**: Click the Submit button to send data to the back-end API for processing.
- **Output**: The app displays output in a modal.
